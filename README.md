# Kaleidoscope: Learnable Masks for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning


This is the implementation of our paper "[Kaleidoscope: Learnable Masks for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning]()" in NeurIPS 2024.

## Getting Started

For setting up environment and running experiments, please see the `README.md` files under corresponding folders.
